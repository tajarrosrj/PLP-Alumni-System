PLP Alumni System (Web-Based with Database)

Project Overview  
This is a simple web-based alumni management system built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP. It was created as a final project for our Open Source Programming with Database subject in 3rd year, 1st semester. The primary focus of the project is to manage alumni records, profiles, and information through a centralized platform with both frontend and backend functionality.

While the system serves its purpose for educational use, additional features and improvements may still be added in future versions.

Technologies Used  
The project is built using the following technologies:

HTML: For the structure and layout of the system.  
CSS: For styling the interface and design.  
Bootstrap: For responsive layout and UI components.  
JavaScript: For basic interactivity and client-side behavior.  
PHP: For backend/server-side logic.  
MySQL: For database storage and management.

You can choose any folder on your local system. For example, you can use the Documents or Desktop folder. Use the File Explorer or terminal to navigate to the desired folder.  
For example, in your terminal, you might run:
